        The following requirements have been set for the project to be submitted:
        - The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports. (Mobile first)
        - Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly.
        - Add a ServiceWorker to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. (Offline first)
        - Users are able to mark a restaurant as a favorite, this toggle is visible in the application. A form is added to allow users to add their own reviews for a restaurant. Form submission works properly and adds a new review to the database.
        - The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline. User is able to add a review to a restaurant while offline and the review is sent to the server when connectivity is re-established.
        - Lighthouse targets for each category exceed:
        -- Progressive Web App: >90
        -- Performance: >90
        -- Accessibility: >90`,
